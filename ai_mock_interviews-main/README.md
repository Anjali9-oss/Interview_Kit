# 🎯 PrepWise - AI Mock Interview System |Your Smart Interview Coach 🎤🧠

Hey there! 👋  
I built this project to **supercharge my interview prep** and help others do the same. It's not just a fun coding experiment — it's a **real-world AI mock interviewer**, built with modern tech like **Next.js**, **Vapi**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**. ⚡

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted something **practical, impactful**, and **resume-worthy** — so I built a system that:
- Talks to you like a real interviewer 🎙️
- Asks technical/behavioral questions with AI 🤖
- Gives voice-to-text transcripts ✍️
- And stores sessions so you can track progress 📊

It’s like **LeetCode + ChatGPT + a virtual interviewer** in one. 🙌
